	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction In Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial ({INTERACT}) study suggests that early intensive blood pressure ({BP}) lowering can attenuate hematoma growth at 24 hours after intracerebral hemorrhage. The present analyses aimed to determine the effects of treatment on hematoma and perihematomal edema over 72 hours.
Methods—{INTERACT} included 404 patients with {CT}-confirmed intracerebral hemorrhage, elevated systolic {BP} (150 to 220 mm Hg), and capacity to start {BP}-lowering treatment within 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients were randomly assigned to an intensive (target systolic {BP} 140 {mmHg}) or standard guideline-based management of {BP} (target systolic {BP} 180 mm Hg) using routine intravenous agents. Baseline and repeat {CTs} (24 and 72 hours) were performed using standardized techniques with digital images analyzed centrally. Outcomes were increases in hematoma and perihematomal edema volumes over 72 hours.
Results—Overall, 296 patients had all 3 {CT} scans available for the hematoma and 270 for the edema analyses. Mean systolic {BP} was 11.7 mm Hg lower in the intensive group than in the guideline group during 1 to 24 hours. Adjusted mean absolute increases in hematoma volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 2.40 and 0.15 in the guideline group compared with −0.74 and −2.31 in the intensive group, respectively, an overall difference of 2.80 (95\% {CI}, 1.04 to 4.56; P=0.002). Adjusted mean absolute increases in edema volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 6.27 and 10.02 in the guideline group compared with 4.19 and 7.34 in the intensive group, respectively, for an overall difference of 2.38 (95\% {CI}, −0.45 to 5.22; P=0.10).
Conclusion—Early intensive {BP}-lowering treatment attenuated hematoma growth over 72 hours in intracerebral hemorrhage. There were no appreciable effects on perihematomal edema.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}) and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN}) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler–Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN}’s performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion’s Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN}’s volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

In the following step, the segmentation of {CT} images having {ICH} is performed using a new hybrid method for automatic segmentation. The proposed method has hierarchical structure and is based on unsupervised fuzzy clustering and expert system-based labeling. The hierarchical structure has two levels: the global and the local. The segmented images are interpolated and a quantitative analysis is performed in the final step of the procedure.

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used for the identification of abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke {CT} images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of {CT} images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent voxelwise comparison with a group of control {CT} images for defining areas with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from {CT} scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate short-term case fatality and long-term mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) and subarachnoid hemorrhage ({SAH}) using data from The Health Improvement Network database.
Methods: Thirty-day case fatality was stratified by age, sex, and calendar year after {ICH} and {SAH} using logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of death during the first year of follow-up and survivors at 1 year.
Results: Case fatality after {ICH} was 42.0\%, compared with 28.7\% after {SAH}. It increased with age ({ICH}: 29.7\% for 20–49 years, 54.6\% for 80–89 years; {SAH}: 20.3\% for 20–49 years, 56.7\% for 80–89 years; both p-trend {\textless} 0.001), and decreased over the period 2000–2001 to 2006–2008 ({ICH}: from 53.1\% to 35.8\%, p-trend {\textless} 0.001; {SAH}: from 33.3\% to 24.7\%, p-trend = 0.02). Risk of death was significantly higher among stroke patients during the first year of follow-up compared with controls ({ICH}: hazard ratio [{HR}] 2.60, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 2.09–3.24, p {\textless} 0.01; {SAH}: {HR} 2.87, 95\% {CI} 2.07–3.97, p {\textless} 0.01) and remained elevated among survivors at 1 year ({ICH}: {HR} 2.02, 95\% {CI} 1.75–2.32, p {\textless} 0.01; {SAH}: {HR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 1.02–1.69, p = 0.03).
Conclusions: More than one-third of individuals die in the first month after hemorrhagic stroke, and patients younger than 50 years are more likely to die after {ICH} than {SAH}. Short-term case fatality has decreased over time. Patients who survive hemorrhagic stroke have a continuing elevated risk of death compared with matched individuals from the general population.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The reliability of hematoma volume ({HV}) measurement using the {ABC}/2 method in multicenter clinical trials is unknown. We determined the accuracy of {ABC}/2 method as an on-site test in comparison with the gold standard central {HV}-assessment and semiautomatic {HV}-assessment.
Method—We analyzed data from an acute intracerebral hemorrhage multicenter clinical trial. {HV} was measured by site investigators to determine enrollment eligibility ({\textless}60 cm3) using the {ABC}/2 method (on-site {HV}), and independently by the core-imaging laboratory using computer-based analysis (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization [{MIPAV}] {HV}). {HV} was also measured by {ABC}/2 method (central {HV}) at the core-imaging laboratory to assess the difference in measurements between on-site (multiple raters with variable experiences) and central (single experienced rater) {HVs}.
Results—Fifty-six subjects were analyzed (mean age 62±15 years; 45\% women). On-site {HV} values showed a significantly lower correlation with the {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.63) than central {HV} and {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.93) values. The correlation between on-site {HV} and central {HV} values was modest (r=0.51). A total of 73\% of the central {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}, whereas only 46\% of the on-site {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs} (P{\textless}0.001). One protocol violation occurred as a result of inaccuracy of on-site {HV} measurement.
Conclusion—On-site {HV} measurements showed high variability, but the impact on the eligibility determination was small. Centralized remeasurements of {HVs} with feedback to the sites may increase the reliability of the on-site {HV} measurements.

	abstract = {Background
{TMS} (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and {DTT} (diffusion tensor tractography) have different advantages in evaluating stroke patients. {TMS} has good clinical accessibility and economical benefit. On the contrary, {DTT} has a unique advantage to visualize neural tracts three-dimensionally although it requires an expensive and large {MRI} machine. Many studies have demonstrated that {TMS} and {DTT} have predictive values for motor outcome in stroke patients. However, there has been no study on the comparison of these two evaluation tools. In the current study, we compared the abilities of {TMS} and {DTT} to predict upper motor outcome in patients with {ICH} (intracerebral hemorrhage).
Methods
Fifty-three consecutive patients with severe motor weakness were evaluated by {TMS} and {DTT} at the early stage (7–28 days) of {ICH}. Modified Brunnstrom classification ({MBC}) and the motricity index of upper extremity ({UMI}) were evaluated at onset and 6 months after onset.
Results
Patients with the presence of a motor evoked potential ({MEP}) in {TMS} or a preserved corticospinal tract ({CST}) in {DTT} showed better motor outcomes than those without (p = 0.000). {TMS} showed higher positive predictive value than {DTT}. In contrast, {DTT} showed higher negative predictive value than {TMS}.
Conclusions
{TMS} and {DTT} had different advantages in predicting motor outcome, and this result could be a reference to predict final neurological deficit at the early stage of {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose The clinical features of thalamic hemorrhage in terms of localization are of great interest in many studies. To better understand the relationship between the localization of thalamic hemorrhage and clinical features, we evaluated the characteristics of patients with four different topographic types of thalamic hemorrhage.
Methods We prospectively studied 100 patients with thalamic hemorrhage who were admitted consecutively to our primary care unit. We divided them into two groups according to large ({\textgreater}2 cm in diameter and/or {\textgreater}4 {mL} in volume) and small thalamic hemorrhage. Four topographic subgroups (large and small) were compared to identify clinical syndromes associated with distinct lesion locations.
Results All patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage had severe sensorimotor deficit. Neuropsychological disturbances in patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were prominent, with primarily transcortical aphasia in those with left-sided lesions and hemineglect and anosognosia in those with right-sided lesions. Several variants of vertical gaze dysfunction, skew ocular deviation, gaze preference toward the site of the lesion, and miotic pupils were frequent in posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage, particularly in the large type. Patients with small and large anterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were characterized by severe motor and sensory deficits; language and oculomotor disturbances were also observed, although less frequently than in posterolateral hemorrhage. Sensorimotor deficits were observed in patients with medial thalamic hemorrhage (moderate in small hemorrhages and severe in large hemorrhages because of involvement of the adjacent internal capsule). Language disturbances in patients with left-sided lesions and neglect in patients with right-sided lesions were seen only in large medial thalamic hemorrhage. Dorsal thalamic hemorrhage was rare and characterized by mild and transient sensorimotor disturbances. Among patients with dorsal thalamic hemorrhages, only those with large lesions had oculomotor and neuropsychological disturbances.
Conclusions We concluded that despite clinical similarity among the four types of thalamic hemorrhage, there was some discrepancy in the clinical features of small and large thalamic hemorrhages. The most important predictors of death were initial consciousness, nuchal rigidity, maximum size, volume and ventricular extension of hemorrhage, and occurrence of hydrocephalus.},

	abstract = {Purpose The subarachnoid space ({SAS}) lies between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the human brain, normally filled with cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). Subarachnoid hemorrhage ({SAH}) is a serious complication of neurological disease that can have high mortality and high risk of disability. Computed tomography ({CT}) head scans are often used for diagnosing {SAH} which may be difficult when the hemorrhage is small or subtle. A computer-aided diagnosis system from {CT} images is thus developed to augment image interpretation. Methods Supervised learning using the probability of distance features of several landmarks was employed to recognize {SAS}. For each {CT} image, the {SAS} was approximated in four steps: (1) Landmarks including brain boundary, midsagittal plane ({MSP}), anterior and posterior intersection points of brain boundary with the {MSP}, and superior point of the brain were extracted. (2) Distances to all the landmarks were calculated for every pixel in the {CT} image, and combined to construct a high-dimensional feature vector. (3) Using head {CT} images with manually delineated {SAS} as training dataset, the prior probabilities of distances for pixels within {SAS} and non-{SAS} were computed. (4) Any pixel of a head {CT} scan in the testing dataset was classified as an {SAS} or non-{SAS} pixel in a Bayesian decision framework based on its distance features. Results The proposed method was validated on clinical head {CT} images by comparison with manual segmentation. The results showed that the automated method is consistent with the gold standard. Compared with elastic registration based on grayscale information, the proposed method was less affected by grayscale variation between normal controls and patients. Compared with manual delineation, the average spatial overlap, relative overlap, and similarity index were, respectively, 89, 63, and 76\% for the automatic {SAS} approximation of the 69 head {CT} scans tested. The proposed method was tested for {SAH} detection and yielded a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 92\%. Conclusion Automated {SAH} detection with high sensitivity was shown feasible in a prototype computer-aided diagnosis system. The proposed method may be extended for computer-aided diagnosis of several {CSF}-related diseases relevant to {SAS} abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Physicians evaluate computed tomography ({CT}) of the brain to quantitatively and qualitatively identify various types of intracranial hematomas for patients with neurological emergencies. We propose a novel method that can perform this task in a totally automatic fashion, based on a multiresolution binary level set method. The skull regions are segmented in downsized images generated with a maximum filter. The intracranial regions are located using the average gray levels and connectivity. These regions compose the regions of interest ({ROIs}) for segmenting the hematoma from the normal brain. The gray levels of the voxels within these {ROIs} are generated with an averaging filter in a multiresolution fashion. After identifying the candidate hematoma voxels using adaptive thresholds and connectivity, binary level set algorithm is applied repeatedly until the original resolution is reached. We apply our method to non-volumetric non-contrast {CT} images of 15 surgically proven intracranial hematomas and the results were quantitatively evaluated by a human expert. The correlation coefficient between the volumes measured manually and automatically is 0.97. The overlap metrics ranged from 0.97 to 0.74, with an average of 0.88. The average precision and recall are 0.89 and 0.87, respectively. We use decision rules to classify these hematomas and were able to make correct diagnoses in all cases.},

Leave-one-out cross validation on eight datasets with lesions of varying appearances is performed, showing our method to compare favourably with other published approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.

The purpose of this study was to begin to develop automated methods of analysis of {CT} scans to identify putative hypodensity within the lentiform nucleus and insula in patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke.
{METHODS}: Thirty-five {CT} scans were retrospectively selected from our {CT} archive (scans of 20 normal control participants and 15 patients presenting with acute middle cerebral artery stroke symptoms). The {DICOM} data for each participant were interpolated to a single volume, scalp stripped, normalized to a standard atlas, and segmented into anatomic regions. Voxel densities in the lentiform nucleus and insula were compared with the contralateral side at P {\textless} .01 using the Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum statistic, corrected for spatial autocorrelation.
{RESULTS}: The quality of the registration for the anatomic regions was excellent. The control group had two false-positive results. The patient group had two false-negative results in the lentiform nucleus, two false-negative results in the insular cortex, and one false-positive finding for the insular cortex. The remainder of the infarcts were correctly identified. The original clinical reading, performed at the time of presentation, produced five false-negative interpretations for the patient group, all of which were correctly identified by the automated algorithm.
{CONCLUSION}: We present an automated method for identifying potential areas of acute ischemia on {CT} scans. This approach can be extended to other brain regions and vascular territories and may aid in the interpretation of {CT} scans in cases of hyperacute stroke.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10–100 {mL} and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients.
Methods
In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number {ISRCTN}22153967.
Findings
307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} −4·3 to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367).
Interpretation
The {STICH} {II} results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

	abstract = {Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({DWI}) is routinely used for early detection of cerebral ischemic changes in acute stroke. Fast acquisition with a standard echoplanar imaging technique generally compromises the image signal-to-noise ratio and in-plane resolution resulting in a reduction of the conspicuity and definition of lesions in the acquired data when viewed on a standard 8-bit display. We present a novel method for automatically and adaptively determining the window settings that enhance the contrast of the image relative to the ischemic lesions. The method performs a coarse segmentation of the lesions followed by contrast-to-noise ratio based computation of the optimal window parameters. The proposed method was tested on 24 datasets acquired with different protocols. The contrast improvement of the lesions is validated through a mirror region of interest analysis and by using the contrast improvement ratio metric. The average obtained improvement in contrast ranges from 25\% to 60\%. Preliminary results of segmentation showed a good reduction in the false positives and improvement in the lesion boundaries. A perception study of the windowed results against 8 radiologists was conducted. Reduction of 14.17\% in the mean response time of detection was observed. Statistical analysis performed using t-test validates the reduction in mean response time to be significant. Results presented in the study show promise in the method.},

	abstract = {{AbstractBackground}
X-ray computed tomography ({CT}) imaging of the brain is commonly used in diagnostic settings. Although {CT} scans are primarily used in clinical practice, they are increasingly used in research. A fundamental processing step in brain imaging research is brain extraction — the process of separating the brain tissue from all other tissues. Methods for brain extraction have either been 1) validated but not fully automated, or 2) fully automated and informally proposed, but never formally validated.
Aim
To systematically analyze and validate the performance of {FSL}'s brain extraction tool ({BET}) on head {CT} images of patients with intracranial hemorrhage. This was done by comparing the manual gold standard with the results of several versions of automatic brain extraction and by estimating the reliability of automated segmentation of longitudinal scans. The effects of the choice of {BET} parameters and data smoothing is studied and reported.
Methods
All images were thresholded using a 0–100 Hounsfield unit ({HU}) range. In one variant of the pipeline, data were smoothed using a 3-dimensional Gaussian kernel (σ = 1 mm3) and re-thresholded to 0–100 {HU}; in the other, data were not smoothed. {BET} was applied using 1 of 3 fractional intensity ({FI}) thresholds: 0.01, 0.1, or 0.35 and any holes in the brain mask were filled.

For validation against a manual segmentation, 36 images from patients with intracranial hemorrhage were selected from 19 different centers from the {MISTIE} (Minimally Invasive Surgery plus recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator for Intracerebral Evacuation) stroke trial. Intracranial masks of the brain were manually created by one expert {CT} reader. The resulting brain tissue masks were quantitatively compared to the manual segmentations using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the Dice Similarity Index ({DSI}). Brain extraction performance across smoothing and {FI} thresholds was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intracranial volume ({ICV}) of each scan was estimated by multiplying the number of voxels in the brain mask by the dimensions of each voxel for that scan. From this, we calculated the {ICV} ratio comparing manual and automated segmentation: I C V automated I C V manual .

To estimate the performance in a large number of scans, brain masks were generated from the 6 {BET} pipelines for 1095 longitudinal scans from 129 patients. Failure rates were estimated from visual inspection. {ICV} of each scan was estimated and an intraclass correlation ({ICC}) was estimated using a one-way {ANOVA}.
Results
Smoothing images improves brain extraction results using {BET} for all measures except specificity (all p \&lt; 0.01, uncorrected), irrespective of the {FI} threshold. Using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1 performed better than 0.35. Thus, all reported results refer only to smoothed data using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1. Using an {FI} of 0.01 had a higher median sensitivity (0.9901) than an {FI} of 0.1 (0.9884, median difference: 0.0014, p \&lt; 0.001), accuracy (0.9971 vs. 0.9971; median difference: 0.0001, p \&lt; 0.001), and {DSI} (0.9895 vs. 0.9894; median difference: 0.0004, p \&lt; 0.001) and lower specificity (0.9981 vs. 0.9982; median difference: − 0.0001, p \&lt; 0.001). These measures are all very high indicating that a range of {FI} values may produce visually indistinguishable brain extractions. Using smoothed data and an {FI} of 0.01, the mean ({SD}) {ICV} ratio was 1.002 (0.008); the mean being close to 1 indicates the {ICV} estimates are similar for automated and manual segmentation.

In the 1095 longitudinal scans, this pipeline had a low failure rate (5.2\%) and the {ICC} estimate was high (0.929, 95\% {CI}: 0.91, 0.945) for successfully extracted brains.
Conclusion
{BET} performs well at brain extraction on thresholded, 1 mm3 smoothed {CT} images with an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1. Smoothing before applying {BET} is an important step not previously discussed in the literature. Analysis code is provided.},

{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}
Infarct volume is used as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials of therapies for acute ischemic stroke. {ABC}/2 is a fast volumetric method, but its accuracy remains to be determined. We aimed to study the accuracy and reproducibility of {ABC}/2 in determining acute infarct volume with diffusion-weighted imaging.
{METHODS}
We studied 86 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Three blinded observers determined volume with the {ABC}/2 method, and the results were compared with those of the manual planimetric method.
{RESULTS}
The {ABC}/2 technique overestimated infarct volume by a median false increase (variable {ABC}/2 volume minus planimetric volume) of 7.33 cm3 (1.29, 22.170, representing a 162.56\% increase over the value of the gold standard (variable {ABC}/2 volume over planimetric volume) (121.70, 248.52). In each method, the interrater reliability was excellent: the intraclass correlations were .992 and .985 for the {ABC}/2 technique and planimetric method, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}
{ABC}/2 is volumetric method with clinical value but it consistently overestimates the real infarct volume. J Neuroimaging 2012;22:155-159},

	abstract = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages ({ICH}) account for 10–30\% of all strokes and are a result of acute bleeding into the brain due to ruptures of small penetrating arteries. Despite major advancements in the management of ischemic strokes and other causes of hemorrhagic strokes, such as ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformations ({AVMs}), or cavernous angioma, during the past several decades, limited progress has been made in the treatment of {ICH}, and the prognosis for patients who suffer them remains poor. The societal impact of these hemorrhagic strokes is magnified by the fact that affected patients typically are a decade younger than those afflicted with ischemic strokes. The {ICH} continues to kill or disable most of their victims. Some studies show that those who suffer {ICH} have a 30-day mortality rate of 35–44\% and a 6-month mortality rate approaching 50\%. Approximately 700,000 new strokes occur in the United States annually and approximately 15\% are hem-orrhagic strokes related to {ICH}. The poor outcome associated with {ICH} is related to the extent of brain damage. {ICH} produces direct destruction and compression of surrounding brain tissue. Direct compression causes poor perfusion and venous drainage to surrounding penumbra at risk, resulting in ischemia to the tissues that most need perfusion [16]. Diagnosis of {ICH} is based largely on clinical history and corroborative Computer Tomography ({CT}) scanning of the brain. The head {CT} scan has a sensitivity and specificity that approach 100\% for acute {ICH}. The hemorrhage volume is the most important predictor of clinical outcome after {ICH} [20]. The volume of {ICH} can be estimated rapidly with a head {CT}. It is an important prognostic indicator and criterion for therapeutic intervention and its expansion can be associated with neurological deterioration. Contrast-enhanced {CT} scan and newer {CT} angiographic ({CTA}) acquisitions can now be performed quickly with the latest-generation scanners. These images can exclude most gross vascular and tumor causes of hemorrhage rapidly and can have an impact on the therapeutic plan [16].},

	abstract = {Purpose An automatic, accurate and fast segmentation of hemorrhage in brain Computed Tomography ({CT}) images is necessary for quantification and treatment planning when assessing a large number of data sets. Though manual segmentation is accurate, it is time consuming and tedious. Semi-automatic methods need user interactions and might introduce variability in results. Our study proposes a modified distance regularized level set evolution ({MDRLSE}) algorithm for hemorrhage segmentation. Methods Study data set (from the ongoing {CLEAR}-{IVH} phase {III} clinical trial) is comprised of 200 sequential {CT} scans of 40 patients collected at 10 different hospitals using different machines/vendors. Data set contained both constant and variable slice thickness scans. Our study included pre-processing (filtering and skull removal), segmentation ({MDRLSE} which is a two-stage method with shrinking and expansion) with modified parameters for faster convergence and higher accuracy and post-processing (reduction in false positives and false negatives). Results Results are validated against the gold standard marked manually by a trained {CT} reader and neurologist. Data sets are grouped as small, medium and large based on the volume of blood. Statistical analysis is performed for both training and test data sets in each group. The median Dice statistical indices ({DSI}) for the 3 groups are 0.8971, 0.8580 and 0.9173 respectively. Pre- and post-processing enhanced the {DSI} by 8 and 4\% respectively. Conclusions The {MDRLSE} improved the accuracy and speed for segmentation and calculation of the hemorrhage volume compared to the original {DRLSE} method. The method generates quantitative information, which is useful for specific decision making and reduces the time needed for the clinicians to localize and segment the hemorrhagic regions.},

	abstract = {Background There is some evidence that hyperglycemia increases the rate of poor outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). We explored the relationship between various parameters of serum glucose concentrations measured during acute hospitalization and hematoma expansion, perihematomal edema, and three month outcome among subjects with {ICH}. Methods A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter prospective study recruiting subjects with {ICH} and elevated systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) ≥170 {mmHg} who presented within 6 h of symptom onset was performed. The serum glucose concentration was measured repeatedly up to 5 times over 3 days after admission and change over time was characterized using a summary statistic by fitting the linear regression model for each subject. The admission glucose, glucose change between admission and 24 hour glucose concentration, and estimated parameters (slope and intercept) were entered in the logistic regression model separately to predict the functional outcome as measured by modified Rankin scale ({mRS}) at 90 days (0–3 vs. 4–6); hematoma expansion at 24 h (≤33 vs. {\textgreater}33\%); and relative perihematomal edema expansion at 24 h (≤40 vs. {\textgreater}40\%). Results A total of 60 subjects were recruited (aged 62.0 ±15.1 years; 56.7\% men). The mean of initial glucose concentration (±standard deviation) was 136.7 mg/dl (±58.1). Thirty-five out of 60 (58\%) subjects had a declining glucose over time (negative slope). The risk of poor outcome ({mRS} 4–6) in those with increasing serum glucose levels was over two-fold relative to those who had declining serum glucose levels ({RR} = 2.64, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.03, 6.75). The {RRs} were 2.59 (95\% {CI}: 1.27, 5.30) for hematoma expansion {\textgreater}33\%; and 1.25 (95\% {CI}: 0.73, 2.13) for relative edema expansion {\textgreater}40\%. Conclusions Decline in serum glucose concentration correlated with reduction in proportion of subjects with hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcome. These results provide a justification for a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of aggressive serum glucose reduction in reducing death and disability among patients with {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Over the last 15 years, basic thresholding techniques in combination with standard statistical correlation-based data analysis tools have been widely used to investigate different aspects of evolution of acute or subacute to late stage ischemic stroke in both human and animal data. Yet, a wave of biology-dependent and imaging-dependent issues is still untackled pointing towards the key question: “how does an ischemic stroke evolve?” Paving the way for potential answers to this question, both magnetic resonance ({MRI}) and {CT} (computed tomography) images have been used to visualize the lesion extent, either with or without spatial distinction between dead and salvageable tissue. Combining diffusion and perfusion imaging modalities may provide the possibility of predicting further tissue recovery or eventual necrosis. Going beyond these basic thresholding techniques, in this critical appraisal, we explore different semi-automatic or fully automatic 2D/3D medical image analysis methods and mathematical models applied to human, animal (rats/rodents) and/or synthetic ischemic stroke to tackle one of the following three problems: (1) segmentation of infarcted and/or salvageable (also called penumbral) tissue, (2) prediction of final ischemic tissue fate (death or recovery) and (3) dynamic simulation of the lesion core and/or penumbra evolution. To highlight the key features in the reviewed segmentation and prediction methods, we propose a common categorization pattern. We also emphasize some key aspects of the methods such as the imaging modalities required to build and test the presented approach, the number of patients/animals or synthetic samples, the use of external user interaction and the methods of assessment (clinical or imaging-based). Furthermore, we investigate how any key difficulties, posed by the evolution of stroke such as swelling or reperfusion, were detected (or not) by each method. In the absence of any imaging-based macroscopic dynamic model applied to ischemic stroke, we have insights into relevant microscopic dynamic models simulating the evolution of brain ischemia in the hope to further promising and challenging 4D imaging-based dynamic models. By depicting the major pitfalls and the advanced aspects of the different reviewed methods, we present an overall critique of their performances and concluded our discussion by suggesting some recommendations for future research work focusing on one or more of the three addressed problems.},

	abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to define the incidence, imaging characteristics, natural history, and prognostic implication of corticospinal tract Wallerian degeneration ({CST}‐{WD}) in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) using serial {MR} imaging.
Methods and Results Consecutive {ICH} patients with supratentorial {ICH} prospectively underwent serial {MRIs} at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days. {MRIs} were analyzed by independent raters for the presence and topographical distribution of {CST}‐{WD} on diffusion‐weighted imaging ({DWI}). Baseline demographics, hematoma characteristics, {ICH} score, and admission National Institute of Health Stroke Score ({NIHSS}) were systematically recorded. Functional outcome at 3 months was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}) and the motor‐{NIHSS}. Twenty‐seven patients underwent 93 {MRIs}; 88 of these were serially obtained in the first month. In 13 patients (48\%), all with deep {ICH}, {CST}‐{WD} changes were observed after a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 7 to 8) as reduced diffusion on {DWI} and progressed rostrocaudally along the {CST}. {CST}‐{WD} changes evolved into T2‐hyperintense areas after a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 14) and became atrophic on {MRIs} obtained after 3 months. In univariate analyses, the presence of {CST}‐{WD} was associated with poor functional outcome (ie, {mRS} 4 to 6; P=0.046) and worse motor‐{NIHSS} (5 versus 1, P=0.001) at 3 months.
Conclusions Wallerian degeneration along the {CST} is common in spontaneous supratentorial {ICH}, particularly in deep {ICH}. It can be detected 1 week after {ICH} on {DWI} and progresses rostrocaudally along the {CST} over time. The presence of {CST}‐{WD} is associated with poor motor and functional recovery after {ICH}.},

We hypothesize that hematoma volume measurement on {QSM} is independent of imaging parameters, eliminating its echo time dependence on gradient echo {MRI}.
Methods—Gradient echo {MRI} of 16 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage was processed with susceptibility-weighted imaging, R2* (=1/T2*) mapping, and {QSM} at various echo times. Hematoma volumes were measured from these images.
Results—Linear regression of hematoma volume versus echo time showed substantial slopes for gradient echo magnitude (0.45±0.31 L/s), susceptibility-weighted imaging (0.52±0.46), and R2* (0.39±0.30) but nearly zero slope for {QSM} (0.01±0.05). At echo time=20 ms, hematoma volume on {QSM} was 0.80× that on gradient echo magnitude image (R2=0.99).
Conclusions—{QSM} can provide reliable measurement of hematoma volume, which can be performed rapidly and accurately using a semiautomated segmentation tool.},

We determined the accuracy of these maps in patients with suspected acute hemispheric stroke.
{METHODS}: Forty-six patients underwent nonenhanced {CT} and dynamic {PCT}, with follow-up {CT} or {MR} imaging. Two observers reviewed the nonenhanced studies for signs of stroke and read the {PCT} maps for {TTP}, {MTT}, {rCBF}, and {rCBV} abnormalities. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and interobserver agreement were compared (Wilcoxon tests). Nonenhanced {CT} and {PCT} data were reviewed for stroke extent according to previously reported methods. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the computerized maps in detecting ischemia and its extent were determined.
{RESULTS}: Compared with nonenhanced {CT}, {PCT} maps were significantly more accurate in detecting stroke (75.7–86.0\% vs. 66.2\%; P {\textless} .01), {MTT} maps were significantly more sensitive (77.6\% vs. 69.2\%; P {\textless} .01), and {rCBF} and {rCBV} maps were significantly more specific (90.9\% and 92.7\%, respectively, vs. 65.0\%; P {\textless} .01). Regarding stroke extent, {PCT} maps were significantly more sensitive than nonenhanced {CT} (up to 94.4\% vs. 42.9\%; P {\textless} .01) and had higher interobserver agreement (up to 0.763). For the computerized map, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, were 68.2\%, 92.3\%, and 88.1\% in detecting ischemia and 72.2\%, 91.8\%, and 87.9\% in showing the extent.
{CONCLUSION}: Dynamic {PCT} maps are more accurate than nonenhanced {CT} in detecting hemispheric strokes. Despite limited spatial coverage, {PCT} is highly reliable to assess the stroke extent.},

	abstract = {Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract ({CST}) after motor pathway ischemic stroke can be characterized by diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). However, the dynamic evolution of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} has not previously been completely identified. We investigated this dynamic evolution and the relationship between early changes of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} and long-term clinical outcomes. {DTI} and neurological examinations were performed repeatedly in 9 patients with first-onset motor pathway subcortical infarction at 5 consecutive time points, i.e. within 1 week, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. Using a region of interest method, we analyzed the ratios of the fractional anisotropy ({rFA}), mean diffusivity ({rMD}), primary eigenvalue (rλ1) and transverse eigenvalue (rλ23) between the affected and unaffected sides of the {CSTs}. We did not find any significant changes in the diffusion indices of the contralesional {CSTs} across time points. The {rFA} decreased monotonously during the first 3 months and then stabilized. The {rMD} increased after 2 weeks and stabilized after the third month. The rλ1 decreased during the first 2 weeks and then remained unchanged. The rλ23 increased during the first 3 months and then stabilized. We also found that the changes in the {rFA} between the first 2 time points were correlated with the {NIHSS} (P = 0.00003) and the Motricity Indices (P = 0.0004) after 1 year. Our results suggest that for patients with motor pathway stroke the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} stabilize within 3 months and that early changes in the {rFA} of the {CST} may predict long-term clinical outcomes.},
